                <p>First of all, again I will introduce myself. Hi, My name is Daniela V. Marquez and you can call me ela or dan. At moment I live in Santol, Boac, Marinduque. 
                The course I took was BS Information Technology and second year student at the Marinduque State College. Many peoeple have told me that I seem grumpy, but after
                they get to know me, they realize that Iam actually friendly and not grumpy. I'm simple person with a good heart and can easily get along with other people, but 
                sometimes when I'm in the mood I just want to be alone. I am a person who is positive about every aspect of my life but sometimes it also becomes negative but I
                thought more about the positive outcome. There are many things I like to do and to experience. I like to learn how to make up, sew clothes and playing any sports. 
                One of the things I want to experince is travel to other countries such as South Korea, Thailand, Japan and many more that someday I can fulfill and enjoy. I like
                to watch the sunset every afternoon when we go to the sea and I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean which I often do too when I'm sad. My parents always 
                told me that you should finish your studies so that you can ave a good life which I am still doing and be a good son to them. My hobby is watching anime and kdrama 
                in my free time, it's also one of my stress relievers so I can somehow have fun and it makes me happy.</p>
